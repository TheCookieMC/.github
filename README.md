Welcome to the offical github page for TheCookieMC! Here, you will find all of our API's information and documentation!

### What is TheCookieMC?
TheCookieMC is a Java minigame network!

Our server is currently in a closed beta state, but we'll sometimes post invites in our discord server to help us test & may eventually change into a fully fledged server!
